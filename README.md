In this course you will learn all about Object Oriented Programming using C#. We'll start from the very basics, with very simple and didactic examples, and from there we will gradually advance, until we delve into in-depth topics such as interfaces, polymorphism, SOLID principles, design patterns, generics, lambda expressions, delegates, LINQ and much more.
